# Orchestra

Orchestra is the backend API and persistence layer behind the Unify stack. It exposes the REST API used by `unify`, `console`, `unity`, and the communication services, and stores the durable state those systems depend on.

## What This Repo Contains

- FastAPI application and API routers
- SQLAlchemy models, DAOs, and Alembic migrations
- background routines for billing, cleanup, notifications, and storage workflows
- observability and deployment configs for managed environments
- API, database, and service tests

## Related Repositories

- [Console](https://github.com/unifyai/console) — Web UI that reads and writes Orchestra data
- [Unity](https://github.com/unifyai/unity) — AI assistant brain that persists state through Unify

## Quick Start

For a local development instance with PostgreSQL + pgvector:

```bash
cp .env.example .env

docker run --name orchestra-db -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=orchestra -e POSTGRES_USER=orchestra -e POSTGRES_DB=orchestra \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg15

poetry install --with dev
alembic upgrade head
poetry run python -m orchestra
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v0`.

## System Architecture

Orchestra is the backend API and database layer in a multi-repository system:

## Security

### Authentication

All API endpoints under `/v0/` require a Bearer token via the `Authorization` header, except:
- `GET /v0/health` — unauthenticated health check
- `POST /v0/webhooks/stripe` — Stripe signature verification (no API key)

Admin endpoints under `/v0/admin/` require the `ORCHESTRA_ADMIN_KEY`. This key comparison uses `secrets.compare_digest()` for timing-attack resistance. Admin endpoints also support OIDC token verification from the `CLOUD_SCHEDULER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` service account.

### Prometheus Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint requires Bearer token authentication via the `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_TOKEN` environment variable. User email addresses are excluded from metric labels to avoid PII exposure.

### Rate Limiting

An IP-based rate limiter protects admin endpoints, `/metrics`, and webhook endpoints (60 requests per IP per 60-second window).

### Security Headers

All responses include: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Permissions-Policy`.

### Required Environment Variables (Security)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ORCHESTRA_ADMIN_KEY` | Admin API authentication |
| `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_TOKEN` | Metrics endpoint authentication |
| `CLOUD_SCHEDULER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | (Optional) Service account email for OIDC-based scheduler auth |

### Managed Infrastructure

Managed deployments rely on GCP services such as Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Cloud Storage, Cloud Scheduler, and Cloud Armor. Those operational settings live outside this repo and are intentionally not reproduced here.

```

## Poetry

This project uses poetry to manage dependencies.
To install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

For development, you can activate the poetry virtual environment by:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Secrets / Environment Variables

Use `.env.example` as the starting point for local development and create a local `.env` with the values appropriate for your environment. VSCode will usually load `.env` automatically, but you may need to configure your IDE or shell to do the same.

## Running the tests

To run the orchestra test suite, you will need the poetry environment and a PostgreSQL server running with the `pgvector` extension installed. The tests and vector functions require `pgvector`.

Recommended (pgvector-enabled Postgres container):

```bash
docker run --name orchestra-db -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=orchestra -e POSTGRES_USER=orchestra -e POSTGRES_DB=orchestra \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg15
```

Once the database server is running, install dependencies (including dev) and run the tests using the poetry environment. Take into account that some tests will require **secrets and environment variables**.

```bash
poetry install --with dev
poetry run pytest -vv .
```

If you see an error like `extension "vector" is not available`, your Postgres instance lacks pgvector. Use the image above or install pgvector in your local Postgres and run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` in the target database.

## Running orchestra

To run the orchestra service locally, you will need a database with valid data, the corresponding secrets/environment variables, and the poetry environment.

If you already have a docker container running Postgres with pgvector you won't need to create a new image. Otherwise:

```bash
docker run --name orchestra-db -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=orchestra -e POSTGRES_USER=orchestra -e POSTGRES_DB=orchestra \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg15
```

Everytime you create a new container, you should run migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade "head"
```

Now, connect to the PSQL database (password=`orchestra`):

```bash
psql -h localhost -U orchestra -d orchestra
```

Your DB should now be fully functional! Now, you should be able to see all the tables (e.g. `\dt`).

To run the service, you can do `poetry run python -m orchestra` but you won't be able to debug the service.

To run orchestra in debug mode (in VSCode / Codespaces), your `launch.json` file should look something like this:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: FastAPI",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "uvicorn",
            "args": [
                "orchestra.web.application:get_app",
                "--reload"
            ],
            "jinja": true,
            "justMyCode": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Once the service is running, you can send requests to http://127.0.0.1:8000/v0

## Observability

Orchestra uses a comprehensive observability stack for monitoring, logging, and tracing.

### Local Development Setup

For local development, you can run the observability stack using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f orchestra/observability/docker-compose.observability.yml up -d
```

This will start Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana containers locally. You can access Grafana at http://localhost:3000.

### Managed Observability

Managed deployments use Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana for metrics, logs, and tracing. For local usage details, refer to the [Observability README](./orchestra/observability/README.md).

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "ORCHESTRA_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "orchestra/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "ORCHESTRA_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `orchestra.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
ORCHESTRA_RELOAD="True"
ORCHESTRA_PORT="8000"
ORCHESTRA_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pytest async configuration

We use pytest-asyncio in STRICT mode. The default fixture loop scope is already set to `function` in `pyproject.toml`, so you should not see related deprecation warnings.

## OpenTelemetry

If you want to start your project with OpenTelemetry collector
you can add `-f ./deploy/docker-compose.otlp.yml` to your docker command.

Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.otlp.yml --project-directory . up
```

This command will start OpenTelemetry collector and jaeger.
After sending a requests you can see traces in jaeger's UI
at http://localhost:16686/.

This docker configuration is not supposed to be used in production.
It's only for demo purpose.

You can read more about OpenTelemetry here: https://opentelemetry.io/
